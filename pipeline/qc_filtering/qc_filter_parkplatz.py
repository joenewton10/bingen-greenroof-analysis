"""
Quality-control filter for parkplatz staging data.
Uses permissive ranges that accommodate observed data characteristics.

Table naming convention for Bingen pipeline:
- Source: ingested_parkplatz
- Output: qc_filtered_parkplatz

NOTE: Known data quirks:
- air_pressure_mbar: Consistently ~800 (possibly uncalibrated or high elevation)
- rain_abs_mm: Cumulative counter that can exceed 600mm
