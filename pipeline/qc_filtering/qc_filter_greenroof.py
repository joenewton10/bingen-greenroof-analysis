"""
Quality-control filter for greenroof ingested tables from Empower and Kissel.
Uses simplified schema (no metadata/counter/system columns).

Table naming convention for Bingen pipeline:
- Source: ingested_empower_greenroof, ingested_kissel_greenroof
- Output: qc_filtered_greenroof

NOTE: Known data quirks:
- soil_temp_2: Often -50.0 (sentinel for missing/disconnected sensor)
- This is handled by allowing values equal to -50 to pass through
